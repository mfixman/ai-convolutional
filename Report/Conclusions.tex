\section{Conclusions and Reflections}

So, which one is the best model?

As shown in \cref{comparison_section}, our original canonical metrics of intersection-over-union and instance intersection-over-union aren't very effective in our dataset.
In other tests, we found that the dice index has similar problems to compare these models.
