\section{Introduction}

In this study we have deployed the freely available Cityscapes dataset \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/CordtsORREBFRS16} to perform semantic segmentation analysis on urban scene imagery using a variety of Deep Learning architectures. Semantic segmentation is a computer vision technique used to identify and label specific parts of an image at pixel level. The main goal is to partition an image into areas (segments) that correspond to different objects or classes of interest (for example person, car, tree, road, building etc.). This technique is widely used in various fields like for instance, in autonomous driving, where it helps cars understand the  environment around them, as well as in medical imaging, remote sensing, and robotics. Semantic segmentation is typically performed using deep learning methods, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and their variants as well as more recent attention-based models.
