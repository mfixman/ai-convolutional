\subsection{Baseline Model}

\subsection{Enhanced Model 1: UNet}

\subsection{Enhanced Model 2: Swin2 \\ \scriptsize \url{https://wandb.ai/mfixman-convolutional-team/work/runs/wspszqbr}}

The Swin2 model has the lowest validation loss of the three models.
The dropout makes it overfit late and slowly; the best loss is found only after 30 epochs, and ever after overfitting the training loss drops slowly.
